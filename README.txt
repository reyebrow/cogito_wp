== How to Use this theme: ==

We recommend that you don't change the code in this theme unless you really 
have to hack it. 

If you DO change the code in this theme make sure to back it up since when 
we provide updates they might overwrite what you've done

"So how to I use this theme?", you might ask.

It's all about child themes.

"Why child themes?"
-Child themes allow you to take most of what we've already and build on it.

A child theme contains only the changes you make to the parent so it's much 
easier to keep straight.

-With child themes you let the theme developers and the Zurb Foundation folks 
handle all the heavy lifting and focus on what's important to you: your site.

We've included a child theme for you in the STARTER_CHILD FOLDER. To get started, 
copy this folder to your wp-content/themes folder and rename it. That's it! Then 
just open up the child's style.css and give it a name. It should then be available 
to use inside WordPress. Cool huh?

Having a blank child theme with just style.css will give you a lot of control over
how the site looks and feels but if you need more customization than what CSS can
give you you'll need to start getting into templates. 

To use templates just copy one (like 'page.php', for example) from cogito_wp to 
your child directory and Voila! You can now modify it.
